title: CutFEM-style methods in FEniCSx: CAD and level sets
abstract:
  - The interest in finite element methods on non-matching meshes has increased in recent years. Theoretical advances, based on the ideas of Nitsche, have allowed for the construction of methods such as CutFEM for a wide variety of problems.
  - From the perspective of implementation, one major challenge is to be able to compute integrals over cells that only have a partial intersection with the domain. Often, quadrature rules for both the volume and surface are required by the method.
  - In this contribution we will present our work on using custom quadrature in the FEniCS-X framework. We focus on domains described by level sets as well as domains from CAD, and restrict ourselves to quadrilateral and hexahedral elements.
