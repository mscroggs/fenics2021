title: Making point sets first class in UFL and Firedrake
abstract:
  - Point data turn up all the time in scientific computing problems&mdash;perhaps you want to know the value of a field at a particular point or set of points, or you have point data that you want to assimilate into a model of some phenomenon. At the moment points are typically expressed as lists of coordinates, thereby bypassing the Unified Form Language's (UFL's) type system of function spaces and meshes.
  - In this talk I will discuss how new concepts such as a "Mesh of Disconnected Vertices" allow point sets to be treated as vectors in a finite element vector space with appropriate UFL arguments and coefficients. I will show how an interpolation operator, onto a function space on such a mesh, can be constructed to represent point evaluations. Since such an operator can be differentiated it fits neatly into the pyadjoint/dolfin-adjoint ecosystem allowing PDE constrained optimisation problems to be solved when, for example, assimilating point data. I will also discuss how this could impact future work to turn UFL into a domain specific language (DSL) for expressing and automating diagnostics on big field datasets produced by climate models.
