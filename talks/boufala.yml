Abstract:	In this talk, we present a numerical implementation of the following nonlinear anisotropic diffusion-based image denoising model, using the computing platform FEniCS Project:\\
$u-u_{0} &= \frac{1}{2 \lambda} \text{div} \left(\frac{1}{\left(\epsilon^2+| \nabla u_\sigma |^2\right)^{1-p/2}}\nabla u \right) && \text{in } \Omega$,\\
$\partial_n u &= 0 && \text{ on } \partial\Omega$.\\\\
$u=u(x,y)$ denotes the unknown image to be recovered, $u_{0}$ is the observed noisy image, $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{2}$ is the spatial image domain and $\partial_{n} u}$ denotes the derivative of $u$ in the direction normal to the boundary $\partial \Omega$.\\\\
We also compare the numerical results with those obtained using finite difference method.\\
First numerical simulations show promising results in terms of denoising performance, but they also show some finite element challenges in denoising some particular images compared to finite difference method.
