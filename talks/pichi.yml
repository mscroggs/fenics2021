title: Artificial neural network for bifurcating phenomena modelled by nonlinear parametrized PDEs
abstract:
  - "This work aims to develop and investigate a computational framework to study parametrized partial differential equations (PDEs) which model nonlinear systems undergoing bifurcations. Bifurcation analysis, ie following the coexisting branches due to the non-uniqueness of the solution, as well as determining the bifurcation points themselves, are complex computational tasks <ref author=\"F.

The combination of reduced basis (RB) model reduction and artificial neural network (ANN) can potentially reduce the computational burden by several orders of magnitude and shed light on new strategies. Following the POD-NN approach <ref author=\"J. S. Hesthaven and S.

We studied the Navier&ndash;Stokes equations for a viscous, steady, and incompressible flow: (i) in a planar straight channel with a narrow inlet of varying width, and (ii) in a triangular parametrized cavity <ref author=\"F.
