Abstract:	A key tenet of the scientific method is that an experiment conducted
in one laboratory may be reproduced in another. For numerical
experiments the process should be straightforward; simply a case of
supplying the same inputs to the same software application. However,
for software applications with complex hierarchies the essential step
of re-creating the same software environment can represent a
significant challenge. Difficulties can emerge in installing library
dependencies on computer systems with different architectures. Even
on the same system changes to low-level libraries over time can
prevent compilation or execution of higher-level code. To address
these issues methods from functional programming have been developed
to guarantee bit-identical software installations. Package
definitions have been created for FEniCS and its dependencies within
the GNU Guix framework. Used as a package manager, GNU Guix provides
the tools to manage a dedicated file structure that sits alongside the
host operating system. This presentation shows how the underlying
mechanism works, how FEniCS fits in and how to create software
environments that can be reproduced identically in space and time.
