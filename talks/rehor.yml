title: Dynamic composition of solvers for coupled problems in DOLFINx
abstract: 
  - Recent developments in DOLFINx allow for the block assembly of linear algebraic systems arising from discretisations of coupled partial differential equations. Each algebraic block represents a subproblem associated with a coupling of the unknown fields. Designing and implementing robust and scalable solution and preconditioning strategies for block-structured linear systems is an active area of research.
  - In this contribution we show how DOLFINx can now exploit one of the most significant features of PETSc; the dynamic composition of the hierarchical solver and preconditioner options at runtime, see Brown <i>et al</i> <ref author="Brown, J., Knepley, M. G., May, D. A., McInnes, L. C., & Smith, B." year="2012" title="Composable Linear Solvers for Multiphysics" journal="Proceedings of the 2012 11th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing (ISPDC '12), IEEE Computer Society, USA" pagestart="55" pageend="62" doi="10.1109/ISPDC.2012.16">. The idea is inspired by the work of Kirby and Mitchell <ref author="Kirby, R., & Mitchell, L.," year="2017" title="Solver Composition Across the PDE/Linear Algebra Barrier" journal="SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing" volume="40" doi="10.1137/17M1133208"> that was originally implemented in the Firedrake Project.
  - "One of the most significant benefits of the approach is the possibility to construct advanced preconditioners that require structure beyond a purely algebraic problem description, eg the pressure-convection-diffusion (PCD) approximation of the Schur complement for the Navier-Stokes equations, see Silvester <i>et al</i> <ref author=\"Silvester, D., Elman, H., & Wathen, A.\" year=\"2014\" title=\"Finite Elements and Fast Iterative Solvers: with applications in incompressible fluid dynamics\" edition=\"second\" series=\"Numerical Mathematics and Scientific Computation\" publisher=\"Oxford University Press\">."
  - We illustrate the capabilities of our implementation on examples ranging from incompressible flow of a viscous fluid, through temperature-driven convection, to flows described by rate-type viscoelastic fluid models.
