title: Dynamic composition of solvers for coupled problems in DOLFINx
abstract: 
- Recent developments in DOLFINx allow for the block assembly of linear algebraic systems arising from discretisations of coupled partial differential equations. Each algebraic block represents a subproblem associated with a coupling of the unknown fields. Designing and implementing robust and scalable solution and preconditioning strategies for block-structured linear systems is an active area of research.
- In this contribution we show how DOLFINx can now exploit one of the most significant features of PETSc; the dynamic composition of the hierarchical solver and preconditioner options at runtime, see Brown et al. [1]. The idea is inspired by the work of Kirby and Mitchell [2] that was originally implemented in the Firedrake Project.
- One of the most significant benefits of the approach is the possibility to construct advanced preconditioners that require structure beyond a purely algebraic problem description, e.g. the pressure-convection-diffusion (PCD) approximation of the Schur complement for the Navier-Stokes equations, see Silvester et al. [3].
- We illustrate the capabilities of our implementation on examples ranging from incompressible flow of a viscous fluid, through temperature-driven convection, to flows described by rate-type viscoelastic fluid models.
