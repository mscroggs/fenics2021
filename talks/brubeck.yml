Abstract:	For problems with smooth solutions, high-order methods have very good
convergence properties, and in some cases they do not exhibit locking
phenomena found in low-order methods. Moreover, due to data-locality
and high arithmetic intensity, they are better suited to make efficient
use of modern parallel hardware architectures. Unfortunately, the
conditioning of the Galerkin matrices is severely affected by $p$, the
polynomial degree of the approximation. In order to obtain practical
iterative solvers, we require good preconditioners.

In the $p$-variant of multigrid, the problem is often coarsened by
rediscretizing on the same mesh with a lower $p$. We implement a
general $p$-multigrid ($p$-MG) method that can deal with general finite
elements and custom coarsening schedules in Firedrake using PETSc. As
relaxation, we employ a novel combination of an approximate fast
diagonalization method and subspace correction. The scheme is
essentially point-block Jacobi in the space of eigenfunctions of a
separable approximation to the local stiffness matrix of each cell. The
relaxation depends on the tensor-product structure of quadrilateral and
hexahedral elements, in a similar manner to sum factorisation.

We employ this relaxation method in two algorithms: a $p$-MG preconditioner and
a full approximation scheme nonlinear solver. We demonstrate how to combine
these two efficiently in a nested iteration with a cascadic outer cycle and
inner V-cycles. All available solvers, including geometric and algebraic
multigrid, may be employed for the $p$-coarse level. The associated
computational costs are $O(p^d)$ to approximate the local stiffness matrix in
$d$ dimensions, and $O(p^{d+1})$ to apply or update the relaxation, while memory
requirements are kept at $O(p^d)$. We present nonlinear examples such as the
$p$-Laplacian and incompressible hyperelasticity.
