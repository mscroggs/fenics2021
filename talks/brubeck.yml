title: Implementation of p-multigrid and approximate fast diagonalization methods in Firedrake
abstract:
  - For problems with smooth solutions, high-order methods have very good convergence properties, and in some cases they do not exhibit locking phenomena found in low-order methods. Moreover, due to data-locality and high arithmetic intensity, they are better suited to make efficient use of modern parallel hardware architectures. Unfortunately, the conditioning of the Galerkin matrices is severely affected by $p$, the polynomial degree of the approximation. In order to obtain practical iterative solvers, we require good preconditioners.
  - In the $p$-variant of multigrid, the problem is often coarsened by rediscretizing on the same mesh with a lower $p$. We implement a general $p$-multigrid ($p$-MG) method that can deal with general finite elements and custom coarsening schedules in Firedrake using PETSc. As relaxation, we employ a novel combination of an approximate fast diagonalization method and subspace correction. The scheme is essentially point-block Jacobi in the space of eigenfunctions of a separable approximation to the local stiffness matrix of each cell. The relaxation depends on the tensor-product structure of quadrilateral and hexahedral elements, in a similar manner to sum factorisation.
  - "We employ this relaxation method in two algorithms: a $p$-MG preconditioner and a full approximation scheme nonlinear solver. We demonstrate how to combine these two efficiently in a nested iteration with a cascadic outer cycle and inner V-cycles. All available solvers, including geometric and algebraic multigrid, may be employed for the $p$-coarse level. The associated computational costs are $O(p^d)$ to approximate the local stiffness matrix in $d$ dimensions, and $O(p^{d+1})$ to apply or update the relaxation, while memory requirements are kept at $O(p^d)$. We present nonlinear examples such as the $p$-Laplacian and incompressible hyperelasticity."
