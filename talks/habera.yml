Abstract:	The FEniCS-X Form Compiler (FFC-X) compiles the symbolic weak formulation
of PDEs into C code.

Historically, its primary focus was on integral operators originating from
weak forms. Using a quadrature rule it generated code to evaluate integrals.
However, a number of applications appeared where symbolic UFL expressions
not involving integrals needed to be compiled into C code - including
interpolation into point-evaluation function spaces.

In this contribution a code generation for UFL symbolic expressions
is described. Code generation and optimisation techniques of FFC-X are
briefly reviewed and improvements needed to compile C code for non-integral,
tensor-valued expressions are described.

New functionality is demonstrated with several examples: efficient
interpolation into Lagrange point-evaluation spaces and assembly of
interpolation and other non-integral operators (discrete gradient,
divergence, curl, etc.). Examples are prepared using the development version
of FEniCS-X.

It is believed that this extension to FFC-X will be used in common practice
by FEniCS users, improve their code performance and widen the applicability
of the entire FEniCS package environment.
