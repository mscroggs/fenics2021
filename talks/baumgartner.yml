title: Total generalized variation for piecewise constant functions
abstract:
  - The total generalized variation (TGV) was introduced as a generalization to the total variation regularizer to avoid the staircasing effect. In particular, the kernel of second-order TGV consists of linear polynomials.
  - Strictly speaking, the functional measures TV on piecewise constant data, however, the concept has become state of the art for recontruction of pixel images using an appropriate discretization.
  - A discrete version of second-order TGV for piecewise constant functions on triangulated meshes is presented in the FEniCS framework. The non-smooth regularizer prefers equally distributed jumps over larger constant areas and thus prevents the visible staircasing effect compared to TV.
  - This is demonstrated for image denoising problems on structured as well as unstructured planar meshes using an implementation of the split Bregman method in FEniCS.
  - The functional is suitable for data on surfaces and can be extended to manifold valued data to measure the total generalized variation of the normal vector.
