title: "UFL to GPU: Generating near roofline actions kernels"
abstract:
- Recent GPUs are capable of providing peak performance up to 6 TFlOps/s (DP), making them an attractive computational target for Finite Element Methods. However, effectively mapping an FEM solver to a GPU remains challenging due to the scattered memory access, large amounts of on-chip state space (eg registers) required for efficient execution, and the inherently large algorithmic variety encountered in local assembly kernels for variational forms.
- In this talk, we focus on accelerating FEM action kernels for matrix-free operators on simplices. We describe a parametrized family of transformation strategies targeting these kernels, a heuristic cost model, and an auto-tuning strategy that enables us to achieve near-roofline performance for a wide variety of variational forms across domains such as fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, and wave motion. We propose a new computational offloading interface for Firedrake, and we have realized our UFL-to-GPU compilation pipeline within this interface. The pipeline can process general UFL with very few limitations and reliably produce routines for high-performance matrix-free 1-form assembly.
- We close with remarks on further potential performance improvement opportunities.
