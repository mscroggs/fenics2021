Abstract:	Modelling the solidification of alloys remains challenging, as there is a multi-physics problem to be solved involving fluid flow, heat transfer as well as phase changes. Shape casting processes are constantly sought to be improved, which can potentially be achieved through accurate and fast modelling of the alloy solidification process. We present in a short overview our approach of an application relying on FEniCS that will be used to model such solidification problems. The model, which is currently under development, follows a volume-averaged two-phase approach, as proposed by Beckermann et. al [1].
Simplified models have been tested and used to generate snapshots for a non-intrusive reduced order model. As this application is being built in Python, we hope its flexible core will open up new opportunities for fast and accurate reduced order models.
