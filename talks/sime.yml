title: A tracer's sojourn in a compressible velocity field
abstract:
- Pointwise satisfaction of the continuity equation is key to precise advection of tracer data through incompressible velocity fields.
- In this presentation we explore tracer advection in the context of weakly compressible flows arising in anelastic fluids.
- To do this we exploit the hybrid discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method via the GeoPart and LEoPart libraries in conjunction with the FEniCS project.
- We present some esoteric findings and aesthetic images.
