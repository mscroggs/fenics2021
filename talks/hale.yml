title: "Simple and sharp: Error estimates of Bank&ndash;Weiser type in the FEniCS Project"
abstract:
  - We propose a simple, cheap and parallelisable implementation [Bulle et al., submitted] in DOLFIN and DOLFINx of an implicit a posteriori error estimator introduced in [Bank and Weiser, 1985].
  - The computation of the implicit estimator requires the solution of local Neumann problems in non-standard finite element spaces on each cell of the mesh. These special spaces are usually not available in modern automated finite element software, including the FEniCS Project.
  - Our method bypasses this issue by constructing a linear system on each cell corresponding to the problem in an available finite element space. We restrict this linear system to a non-standard space. On affine-equivalent finite elements, this restriction is constant and its application involves only small dense matrix-matrix multiplications.
  - We show several numerical examples of adaptive mesh refinement driven by this estimator applied to Poisson, Stokes and incompressible linear elasticity, as well as for goal-oriented problems [Becker et al., 2011].
