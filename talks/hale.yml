title: "Simple and sharp: Error estimates of Bank&ndash;Weiser type in the FEniCS Project"
abstract:
  - We propose a simple, cheap and parallelisable implementation <ref author="Raphaël Bulle, Jack S. Hale, Alexei Lozinski, Stéphane P. A. Bordas, Franz Chouly" year="2020" title="Hierarchical a posteriori error estimation of Bank&ndash;Weiser type in the FEniCS Project" arxiv="2102.04360" journal="submitted"> in DOLFIN and DOLFINx of an implicit a posteriori error estimator introduced in <ref author="Bank, R.E. and A. Weiser" year="1985" title="Some a posteriori error estimators for elliptic partial differential equations" doi="10.2307/2007953">.
  - The computation of the implicit estimator requires the solution of local Neumann problems in non-standard finite element spaces on each cell of the mesh. These special spaces are usually not available in modern automated finite element software, including the FEniCS Project.
  - Our method bypasses this issue by constructing a linear system on each cell corresponding to the problem in an available finite element space. We restrict this linear system to a non-standard space. On affine-equivalent finite elements, this restriction is constant and its application involves only small dense matrix-matrix multiplications.
  - We show several numerical examples of adaptive mesh refinement driven by this estimator applied to Poisson, Stokes and incompressible linear elasticity, as well as for goal-oriented problems <ref author="Roland Becker, Elodie Estecahandy, and David Trujillo" year="2011" title="Weighted marking for goal-oriented adaptive finite element methods" doi="10.1137/100794298">.
