Abstract:	When creating higher order finite element spaces, it is vital that neighbouring cells agree on the positioning and orientations of degrees-of-freedom on their shared mesh entities. In this talk, we discuss how reference data can be transformed so that the correct global data is obtained even if the local orientations of two neighbouring cells do not agree. We present examples of how this method is implemented in Basix, FEniCSx's finite element tabulator.
