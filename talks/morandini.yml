title: A two-level nonlinear beam model using adjoints
abstract: A two-level nonlinear beam model, with the two levels linked by first- and second-order adjoints, allows to successfully deal with beam problems characterized by complex and multi-material cross-sections. Emphasis is given to the approach used for coupling the two levels within the FEniCS framework, and on how to overcome a few issues encountered during the actual implementation of the coupling procedure.
