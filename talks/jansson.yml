Abstract:	We present the Digital Math framework as the foundation for
modern science-based on constructive digital mathematical
computation. The computed result (coefficient vector, FEM function,
plot, etc.) is a mathematical theorem, and the mathematical Open
Source code, here in the FEniCS framework, and computation is the
mathematical proof. Based on the Digital Math framework and the FEniCS
realization, we present solutions to some of the grand challenges in
science, education and industry.

In this seminar, we specifically focus on solving the reproducibility
crisis in research, recently highlighted in our panel debate with the
European Commission, Swedish Parliament, Lorena Barba and top Swedish journalist:

We see education as reproducing scientific results of key importance
for society. As part of the seminar, you are invited to participate
in the online DigiMat course on reproducible research, where anyone in
an accessible Ubiquitous High-Performance Computing (UHPC) Digital
Math environment can create your own reproducible “Digital Math”
publication.

Reports from the education system show that almost all students lose
motivation for math and programming somewhere along the way. At the
same time computational math is the fundament of modern society,
creating an enormous societal problem.

We show results that our DigiMat - Digital Math online education
program [1], from pre-school through university and professional is a
solution to this grand challenge in education. DigiMat creates
motivation and learning of the key abstract concepts by playing with,
editing and building your own Digital Math interactive simulations and
virtual worlds. DigiMat Pro has reached 30000+ participants with great feedback, and DigiMat Basic is now reaching schools in Sweden with good results.

We show reproducible predictive Real Flight Simulation as a solution
to the grand challenge of aerodynamics connected to results in the
High Lift Prediction Workshop. For general continuum modeling, such as
biomechanics, we present our Real Unified Continuum framework [2] with
results in food tech, heart modeling, etc.
