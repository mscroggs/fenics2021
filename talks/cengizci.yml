title: Stabilized numerical simulations of hypersonic flows in thermochemical nonequilibrium with FEniCS
abstract: In this talk, we are presenting numerical simulations of inviscid hypersonic flow past a cylinder. It is assumed that the flow environment is in thermochemical nonequilibrium and non-ionized. A 5-species air-mixture and a 17-reaction chemical kinetic model with Park's two-temperature approach are adopted. In performing the relevant simulations, the Galerkin finite element method is stabilized by the compressible-flow Streamline-Upwind/Petrov-Galerkin method. Furthermore, the YZ\(\beta\) shock-capturing is employed to achieve better solution profiles at shocks. The flow field is spatially discretized on an unstructured mesh with triangular elements, and the zero-normal-velocity condition is enforced on the cylinder in a weak sense. The system of algebraic equations resulting from the spatial and temporal discretizations of the governing equations is linearized with the Newton-Raphson technique and then solved in each time-step by the GMRES method with the ILU preconditioning. All the numerical computations are carried out in FEniCS 2019.1.0 environment.
