title:	Generating high-order time stepping methods
abstract:	
- Code generation systems greatly simplify the formulation of physical problems, allowing efficient and accurate discretizations to be rapidly deployed for challenging problems. However, domain-specific languages like UFL currently lack abstractions to describe time-dependence, leaving users to hand-code multistep or Runge-Kutta methods if they wish to obtain high temporal accuracy or utilize special time-stepping strategies.
- In this talk, we describe IRKsome, a simple package that, given a UFL description of a semidiscrete problem and a Butcher tableau, produces UFL for the associated Runge-Kutta method. In this way, we can obtain high-order time-stepping methods with appropriate stability and/or symplecticity properties. On the down side, implicit Runge-Kutta methods lead to algebraic systems coupling together the several stages, which presents greater challenges to the linear solvers. We also present preliminary results on preconditioners.
- Although Irksome currently sits on top of Firedrake, the critical aspects of UFL manipulation (the hard part) should work well with FEniCS or other UFL-based codes.
