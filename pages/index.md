The FEniCS 2021 conference is an opportunity for all those interested in the {{icon:FEniCS}} Project and related projects to exchange ideas, communicate their results and network with the automated scientific computing community.

Unlike previous FEniCS conferences, FEniCS 2021 will be held entirely online.
The talks will be presented using Zoom Webinar. The evening activities will be held using [Gather Town](/gather-town.md). Links to join both of these will be emailed to you a few days before the
conference.

We welcome developers, existing and potential users of the FEniCS ecosystem as well as mathematicians, computer scientists and application domain specialists interested in numerical methods, their implementation and applications.

The FEniCS 2021 conference will emphasise an open and inclusive atmosphere, contributed talks from a diverse range of scientific areas, and dedicated time for discussions and coding.

The FEniCS 2021 conference is sponsored by:
