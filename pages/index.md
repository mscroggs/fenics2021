The FEniCS 2021 conference was an opportunity for all those interested in the {{icon:FEniCS}} Project and related projects to exchange ideas, communicate their results and network with the automated scientific computing community.

Unlike previous FEniCS conferences, FEniCS 2021 was held entirely online.
The talks were presented using Zoom Webinar. The evening activities were held using [Gather Town](/gather-town.md).

We welcomed developers, existing and potential users of the FEniCS ecosystem as well as mathematicians, computer scientists and application domain specialists interested in numerical methods, their implementation and applications.

The FEniCS 2021 conference emphasised an open and inclusive atmosphere, contributed talks from a diverse range of scientific areas, and dedicated time for discussions and coding.
