# Gather Town

In Gather Town, you are represented by a computer-game-style character that you can move around using the arrow keys.
You'll be connected in a video call to other people whose characters are standing near yours. This means you'll be able
to join and leave conversations, mingle with other conference delegates, and track down speakers to ask them about their
talks, just like you would at an in-person conference.

We'll be using Gather Town for the evening activities during FEniCS 2021, although the space will be open throughout the
conference if you want to meet up with anyone at any point during the week.

## The FEniCS 2021 Gather Town space
When you first join Gather Town, you will be taken to the Gather Town tutorial island. Once you've completed the tutorial,
you'll find yourself in the FEniCS 2021 welcome room.

Once you've said hello to a few people and got used to moving yourself around with the arrow keys, head through the door
at the top of the room to enter the lobby.

There are four rooms that can be accessed through this lobby.

### Reception room
The first door to the right leads to the reception room. In this room there is a large open space for mingling,
and a series of tables around the outside for sitting down for a longer conversation.

We will be gathering in this room on [Monday evening](/evening/monday.html) for the drinks reception.

### Meeting room
The first door to the left leads to the meeting room. In this room, there are a collection of tables set up
for delegates to meet up and hold discussions.

We will be gathering in this room on [Tuesday evening](/evening/tuesday.html) for the discussion tables.

### Pub
The second door to the left leads to the pub. In this room, there are a collection of small tables set up
for delegates to meet up for a drink and a chat.

We will be gethering in this room on [Wednesday evening](/evening/wednesday.html) for the FEniCS quiz,
and on [Thursday evening](/evening/thursday.html) for the conference dinner.

### Garden
The second door to the right leads to the garden. This is a space that you can hang out in when you want some
quieter time away from the busy room we are meeting in.

In addition to these rooms, there is also a hidden room somewhere in the space. We hope you enjoy exploring the
space to find it.


## Gather Town features
There are a few features of Gather Town that are worth knowing about.

### Private spaces
In various places throughout the FEniCS Gather Town space, there are 'private spaces' that surround tables. If you
enter one of these spaces you will be able to see and hear everyone in that private space and no-one outside the space.
Entering one of these spaces is a little bit like sitting down at the table to join the conversation. To leave a private
space, you can simply get up and walk away.

### Locating someone
If you want to find someone specific in the space (eg someone who gave a talk that you want to chat to), you can click on their name
in the sidebar, then click "Locate on map". A line will then appear showing you how to get to that person.

### Muting/unmuting
Your video and audio can be muted and unmuted by clicking on the icons in your video preview box at the bottom right of the screen.
If you have issues with video or audio, you can refresh the Gather Town page to reset the settings.

### Ghost
If you get trapped or want to move past people (eg in the pub, there are a couple of narrow corridors), you can press "G" to temporarily
become a ghost. If you are a ghost, you will disappear from the video chat and will be able to walk through people.

### Dancing/applause
You can press "Z" to make your character dance and show a heart above your head. This can be used as a visual replacement of applause.
The heart will disappear once you move your character.

### Interacting with objects.
You can press "X" to interact with some objects in the space. The most useful interactive objects in the FEniCS space are probably
the collaborative whiteboard in the meeting room.
