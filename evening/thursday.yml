title: Conference dinner
desc:
  - At the start of Thursday's evening session, we met in the Gather Town garden to take a conference photo.
  - On Thursday evening, we would normally meet up in a pub for a drink and chat before heading to the conference dinner. There wasn't an actual dinner at this virtual conference, but we met up in the Gather Town pub for a drink and a chat.
