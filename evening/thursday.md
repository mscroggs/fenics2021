# Conference dinner

<div style="margin-top:5px"><a href='/talks/list-Thursday.html'>Thursday</a> evening (19:30&ndash;21:00 GMT)</div>


<div class='abstract'>
On Thursday evening, we would normally meet up in a pub for a drink and chat before heading to
the conference dinner.
There won't be an actual dinner at this virtual conference, but we will be meeting up in the
Gather Town pub for a drink and a chat.

You'll (again) have to bring your own drink: any alcoholic or non-alcoholic drink will do.
